# Usage

Copy `unwind.js` into your PJ64 `Scripts` folder `unwind.dll` into `Scripts/modules`. Modify the `elf_path` variable in `unwind.js` to point to the ELF file for the current ROM and run it from the PJ64 scripts menu. Debugging and interpreter mode must both be enabled in PJ64 for this tool to work correctly.

# Building

Requires make, clang, and visual studio installed. Make sure the first two are on your path, then run make from Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt. Better build instructions coming soon.
